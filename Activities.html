   <h2>Guided Tours</h2>
   <p><strong>Since 1975, all visitors to Galapagos must be accompanied by a certified naturalist guide. These men and women are a key component in the management of the Galapagos National Park: they not only share their knowledge with the visitors, but also act as the eyes and ears of the park service, enforcing rules and notifying the park service about introduced species, trails that need maintenance, etc. The Galapagos guides come from a variety of backgrounds, and all must take and pass the official guide course. Even though their presence is mandated by the park service, many visitors find that their Galapagos guide is an important part of their overall Galapagos experience!</strong>

    <h2>Snorkeling</h2>
    <p><strong>Visitors to the Galapagos Islands expect to see amazing creatures crawling, flying, or basking on the islands. But what surprises many people is the abundance of life just off the shore line, only a few feet down in the water. There is a world teeming with schools of angelfish, gliding manta rays, docile white-tipped reef sharks, and feeding marine iguanas.
Almost all boat tours offer snorkeling as an integral part of their itineraries, but some boats may charge an extra equipment rental fee. Also, the quality of snorkeling equipment may vary widely amongst boats.</strong>
